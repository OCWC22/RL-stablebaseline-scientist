## Project Overview

This project implements and compares reinforcement learning algorithms using the Stable Baselines3 library on the CartPole-v1 environment. We've:

- **Implemented three foundational algorithms**: PPO, A2C, and DQN
- **Created a skeleton for Model-Based PPO** with adaptive imagination
- **Conducted comprehensive performance testing** across environments
- **Developed detailed algorithm documentation and comparison**
- **Used Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for reliability and correctness

The core objective was to validate our algorithm implementation framework through empirical testing before advancing to a full model-based reinforcement learning approach.

## Research Foundation

This project builds on extensive reinforcement learning research:

- **Classical RL Algorithms**: Implemented PPO, A2C, and DQN following SB3 documentation
- **Model-Based RL**: Designed after Sutton's Dyna architecture and recent MBRL papers
- **Adaptive Imagination**: Incorporated model confidence to vary synthetic experience generation
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Added curiosity mechanism based on prediction error

Key design principles include:
- **Sample Efficiency**: Reduce real environment interactions through imagination
- **Robustness**: Use model uncertainty to prevent overfitting to incorrect world models
- **Exploration**: Enhance exploration through curiosity-driven intrinsic rewards

## Implementation Approach

We followed a structured Test-Driven Development approach throughout the project:

1. **Initial Research and Design**: Detailed in `deep_research.md` and `deep_research_2.md`
2. **Project Planning**: Created comprehensive plan in `prd.md`
3. **Test Suite Development**: Following patterns in `starting.md`
4. **Algorithm Implementation**: Starting with standard algorithms before MB-PPO
5. **Verification & Comparison**: Empirical testing documented in `algorithm_comparison.md`
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive explanation in `model_based_rl_explained.md`

All code changes were systematically tracked in `coding_updates_1.md`.
