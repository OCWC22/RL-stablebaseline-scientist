## 05-03-2025 - Updated Project Plan (prd.md)

### Files Updated:
- `/Users/chen/Projects/RL-stablebaseline-scientist/prd.md`: Updated project plan.

### Description:
Revised the project plan in `prd.md` to include specific starter code snippets and `pytest` examples for environment setup, training scripts (PPO, A2C, DQN), and evaluation.

### Reasoning:
The initial plan lacked concrete implementation details required for high reliability and to properly follow the TDD spirit requested by the user and outlined in `starting.md`. This update provides actionable code and test examples, directly referencing requirements from `deep_research.md`, making the plan more accurate and specific.

### Trade-offs:
- The plan is now more detailed and longer, requiring more upfront review.
- Provides a clearer, more verifiable path forward, reducing ambiguity during implementation.

### Considerations:
- Starter code uses hyperparameters from `deep_research.md`.
- Test examples focus on testing the *usage* of Stable Baselines3 components, aligning with the TDD approach from `starting.md` but adapted for leveraging the library.
- Assumes `uv` for package management as per global rules.

### Future Work:
- Implement the code and tests outlined in the revised plan.
- Refine hyperparameters based on actual training runs if needed.

## 05-03-2025 - Updated README.md

### Files Updated:
- `/Users/chen/Projects/RL-stablebaseline-scientist/README.md`: Updated main project README.

### Description:
Populated `README.md` with project structure, setup instructions (clone, venv, `uv pip install`), usage examples (training scripts, evaluation script, TensorBoard), and testing instructions (`pytest tests/`).

### Reasoning:
To provide clear documentation for users on how to set up, run, and test the project, based on the steps defined in the updated `prd.md`.

### Trade-offs:
- None. Essential documentation.

### Considerations:
- Assumes `uv` for installation.
- Includes placeholders for repository URL and specific model paths.

### Future Work:
- Fill in repository URL once available.
- Keep README updated as scripts and functionality are implemented.

## 05-03-2025 - Fixed Environment Setup and Tests

### Files Updated:
- `/Users/chen/Projects/RL-stablebaseline-scientist/tests/test_env_utils.py`: Updated test assertions to handle API changes in Stable Baselines3 v2.6.0

### Description:
Fixed compatibility issues with the test suite by creating a dedicated virtual environment and updating test assertions to handle both list and tuple return types for `infos` in the vectorized environment step method.

### Reasoning:
Stable Baselines3 v2.6.0 changed the return type of `infos` from a list to a tuple in the `step()` method of vectorized environments. The test was updated to accept both formats for better compatibility across versions.

### Trade-offs:
- The test is now more flexible but slightly less strict about the exact return type.

### Considerations:
- Using an isolated virtual environment avoids conflicts with system-wide packages like `langchain_openai` and `deepeval` that were causing Pydantic version conflicts.

### Future Work:
- Update requirements.txt to specify exact version constraints for all dependencies.
- Consider adding version-specific test branches if more API differences are discovered.
