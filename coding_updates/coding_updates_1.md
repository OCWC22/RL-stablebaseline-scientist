## 05-03-2025 - Fixed Structure in Model-Based RL Documentation (Model Explanation)

### Files Updated:
- `/model_based_rl_explained.md`: Fixed duplicated sections and reorganized document structure

### Description:
Resolved an issue with duplicated sections in the model-based RL explanation document, specifically the Implementation Roadmap and Conclusion sections that were appearing twice. Also reorganized the Algorithm Flow section to ensure all steps appear in the correct sequence.

### Reasoning:
The document had become disorganized during the incremental additions of content, resulting in duplicate sections and a confusing flow. This clean-up was necessary to ensure the explanation remained clear and professional for onboarding engineers.

### Trade-offs:
- Maintained all the valuable content while eliminating redundancy
- Preserved the detailed code examples while ensuring they appear in a logical sequence

### Considerations:
- The document structure now follows a more logical progression from concepts to implementation
- Code examples are now properly integrated with their explanatory text
- Recent research section is consolidated into a single, comprehensive list

### Future Work:
- Consider adding diagrams to illustrate the data flow between components
- Add more specific implementation guidance for transitioning from the skeleton to full implementation
- Add benchmarking results comparing MB-PPO with standard PPO once available
